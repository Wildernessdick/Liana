      "content": "\n<p>Are you planning to acquire a newsletter tool? Great decision – email marketing has the <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/know-the-value-of-your-marketing-actions-the-basics-of-roi.html\">highest ROI of all marketing channels</a>!</p>\n<p>This article will present some of the most popular software and discuss their differences. As a cherry on top, we will also take a deeper look at our own <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html\">email marketing platform LianaMailer</a>.</p>\n<p>But before getting to know the tools and making the purchase decision, it’s good to determine your own wishes and needs, and estimate how different options meet those requirements.</p>\n<p>Let’s start! </p>\n<h2>What do you need to think through before comparing email marketing tools?</h2>\n<p>The number of various tools on the market is extensive. To narrow down the selection and make the email marketing tool comparison easier, it’s good to think about what your needs are when it comes to email marketing.</p>\n<p>Go through at least these questions:</p>\n<h3>How large is my contact base?</h3>\n<p>Email marketing solutions are often priced based on the size of your contact database. A tool for 50,000 contacts will cost more than one that covers just a couple of thousand contacts. It's also worth checking out if unsubscribed and inactive contacts are counted in the final amount – this detail can quickly increase the costs.</p>\n<h3>What is my budget?</h3>\n<p>Your budget naturally affects the price range where you want to start searching for tools. More expensive solutions often have a wider selection of features and cover a larger contact database.</p>\n<p>It is also worth checking whether the price is based on monthly or annual billing. The monthly option might be a bit more expensive, but it also provides flexibility, if you need to make changes to the contract with a quick schedule.</p>\n<h3>How advanced editing options do I want to have?</h3>\n<p>Many newsletter tools are built around a drag &amp; drop editor, which often makes the editing process very easy and smooth. There are still differences between the tools – some features, like A/B testing, are not available in all of them. Carefully familiarize yourself with the features and evaluate which of them are necessary for you.</p>\n<p>Also, take into consideration the employees who will participate in the editing process: are they all on the same skill level, or would it be easier to have a newsletter template that can be edited within the limits allowed by your brand?</p>\n<h3>How detailed reports do I want to see?</h3>\n<p>All marketing actions should be measured – email marketing is no exception. With thorough reports, you can analyze the performance of your newsletter and improve your content to meet the expectations of your receivers.</p>\n<p>Once you find software that interests you, check what kind of reporting features it has. Would you like to see heatmaps and analyze which parts of your letter the receivers have clicked? Does the software provide information on what percentage of the sending did not succeed? Are you able to share the reports with the management and other stakeholders?</p>\n<h3>Do I need to follow GDPR legislation or other requirements?</h3>\n<p>A modern marketer has to consider legislation, laws, and regulations related to user data in their area, such as GDPR in the European markets. The chosen tool should make following the rules easier, not put obstacles in the way.</p>\n<h3>Do I want to send automated emails?</h3>\n<p>Email automation helps with the creating and sending process of newsletters. If you are sending repeated emails like booking confirmations, transactional emails, or invitations, automation features are something to consider.</p>\n<p>Get to know the automation possibilities of the tools and see how complex automations they enable. Some email marketing solutions have light, built-in automation features, others integrate with actual marketing automation tools. </p>\n<div class=\"alert border border-200 bg-100\">At this point, you might also find useful tips from our article <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-email-marketing-provider-20-questions-to-help-you.html\">How to Choose the Right Email Marketing Provider – 20 Questions to Help You</a>.</div>\n<p>Now we know what you want and need – the next step is to find a solution that meets those specs in the best way possible.</p>\n<h2>Get to know the popular email marketing tools</h2>\n<p>Now we are ready to take a closer look at different software. We’ll tell you about the features of five different tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mailjet</li>\n<li>Campaign Monitor</li>\n<li>Mailchimp</li>\n<li>Active Campaign</li>\n<li>LianaMailer</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mailjet</h3>\n<p>Mailjet is an easy tool with simple features for email building. Newsletters can be created on pre-built templates without any expert skills – although the selection of templates isn’t particularly wide.</p>\n<p>What makes Mailjet special is the possibility of multiple people attending the editing process at the same time. This feature enables teamwork and can also speed up the process of composing newsletters.</p>\n<p>Mailjet also has a free version available with 200 emails per day and 6,000 emails per month. The free-version emails have the logo on them and naturally, the features are more narrow than with the paid plans.</p>\n<p>There is room for improvement in managing the contact lists, as removing unsubscribed users from your database cannot be done with just a couple of clicks. Also, segmentation options are pretty limited.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"551\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/email-marketing-tool-comparison/cache/mailjet-alternative-799x551.png\" width=\"799\"></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drag &amp; drop editor</li>\n<li>Narrow selection of pre-built templates</li>\n<li>Collaborative real-time editing</li>\n<li>A/B testing</li>\n<li>Email validation</li>\n<li>Real-time statistics</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Campaign Monitor</h3>\n<p>Campaign Monitor might not be the most beautiful tool on the market, but it’s one of the easiest ones to use. Even an inexperienced email marketer can quickly learn to use the software. The navigation and menus are very clear and understandable.</p>\n<p>Campaign Monitor has a simple drag &amp; drop editor with basic-level editing possibilities. The editor is adequate if you don't plan on sending particularly flashy letters, but the more advanced email marketer may get frustrated with the narrow editing options. However, the software offers a nice selection of good-looking and responsive newsletter templates.</p>\n<p>Customer support isn’t Campaign Monitor’s biggest strength. Chat support isn’t offered, and phone support is available only for customers with the most expensive pricing plan. When facing issues, you can send a support ticket after being guided to a help center including support articles. There is no information on how soon your ticket will be replied to or reacted to.</p>\n<p>In addition to paid versions, Campaign Monitor provides a free trial that doesn’t expire. The trial allows you to try the software and enables you to send email campaigns to five subscribers. Autoresponders and transactional emails aren’t included in the trial.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"shadow-image\" height=\"508\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/email-marketing-tool-comparison/campaign-monitor-alternative.png\" width=\"850\"></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple drag &amp; drop editor with ready-made templates</li>\n<li>Functional data segmentation</li>\n<li>Enables marketing automation</li>\n<li>Option to send SMS campaigns</li>\n<li>Free trial available</li>\n<li>Support mostly via tickets, no online support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mailchimp</h3>\n<p>Mailchimp offers multiple ways to build emails: you can build your letter over a ready-made template or use a coded design, for example. The editing possibilities are broad, but might also confuse, as some editing methods have limitations compared to others.</p>\n<p>The UI of the tool is modern and sleek, but not the most uncomplicated: finding the key features might take time in the beginning. The selection of features is broad and there are also many useful integrations to third-party apps, as Mailchimp has the position of an industry-standard tool.</p>\n<p>The amount of emails you can send per month is limited, and the amount varies depending on the pricing plan. This is good to take into account, especially if you take advantage of Mailchimp’s automation features and send a lot of automated emails.</p>\n<p>Mailchimp also has a free version, which can be a great option for small businesses that are starting to send newsletters. However, the free plan covers a maximum of 2,500 emails per month (daily limit of 500) or 500 contacts – unsubscribed and duplicate subscribers are counted.</p>\n<p>Some features, like A/B testing, email scheduling, and personalization are not available in the free version of Mailchimp. The free plan covers support for the first 30 days, after that support is offered only for paying customers.</p>\n<p>For paying customers, phone support is available for customers with the most expensive pricing plan. Email and chat support are available after you have searched for the answer to your issue from Mailchimp’s articles.</p>\n<p>When it comes to segmentation, Mailchimp isn’t the most advanced tool available. If you use a lot of different conditions in your sendings, working with Mailchimp can cause quite a lot of extra work.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"shadow-image\" height=\"701\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/email-marketing-tool-comparison/mailchimp-alternative.png\" width=\"1300\"></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drag &amp; drop editor</li>\n<li>Marketing automation features</li>\n<li>Website building tool included</li>\n<li>Wide selection of ready-made integrations – no custom integrations</li>\n<li>No support for free accounts after the first 30 days</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ActiveCampaign</h3>\n<p>ActiveCampaign comes with handy built-in email automation features, and it’s a tool for companies that are serious about marketing automation. The software also offers many other marketing features, like a CRM solution, campaign landing pages, and live site chat messages.</p>\n<p>A vast selection of features might feel confusing in the beginning – especially if you are only looking for an email marketing solution. The features also come with a larger price tag, as the plan costs are associated with some apps and integrations.</p>\n<p>ActiveCampaign has a drag &amp; drop editor and offers a large selection of ready-made newsletter templates.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"shadow-image\" height=\"1172\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/email-marketing-tool-comparison/active-campaign-alternative.png\" width=\"1800\"></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drag &amp; drop editor</li>\n<li>Wide selection of ready-made templates</li>\n<li>Easy-to-use marketing automation</li>\n<li>Wide selection of other marketing features and integrations</li>\n<li>Support via chat and email – phone support only for Enterprise customers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>LianaMailer</h3>\n<p>Lastly, let’s take a closer look at LianaMailer.</p>\n<p>This drag &amp; drop tool provides you with very versatile editing options. A broad library offers many good-looking newsletter templates that you can keep editing to meet your taste and brand – or you can utilize a custom-made template that is created specifically for you.</p>\n<p>You can astonish your receivers with personalized and interactive newsletter content. Spice up your letter with videos, activate your readers with polls, compose the letters easily by utilizing RSS feeds, and personalize parts of the content based on each receiver’s attributes. You can even send SMS messages with the same platform.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"920\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/email-marketing-tool-comparison/newsletter-template-plant-theme.png\" width=\"1579\"></p>\n<p>LianaMailer is an excellent choice for a GDPR-aware email marketer: you can collect, store, and handle all personal data accordingly and comply with the legislation.

      "description": "Are you ready to expand your marketing to WhatsApp? This article tells you how to get the most out of WhatsApp conversations and data by using the app together with a marketing automation tool.",
      "content": "\n<p>You sure know WhatsApp? The popular mobile messaging app is used by more than 2 billion people in over 180 countries, ranked as the most-used messenger app in the world.</p>\n<p>Together with the fact that the <a href=\"https://front.com/blog/why-sms-is-the-new-channel-for-customer-support\" target=\"_blank\">average open rate for text messages is 98 percent</a>, these numbers provide a huge marketing potential. This is why WhatsApp offers marketing tools for businesses, including in-built marketing automation features that enable automated message flows and sales processes, among other things.</p>\n<p>But even if WhatsApp’s own marketing solutions contain automation features, the greatest benefit is achieved when the messaging app is used together with an actual marketing automation solution. Let us tell you how!</p>\n<h2>The biggest benefits of using marketing automation and WhatsApp together</h2>\n<p>Marketing automation makes WhatsApp marketing much more effective. You can have automated conversations, use the conversation data outside the app and utilize it in your marketing campaigns, and segment your contacts much more precisely.</p>\n<h3>Save time by automating WhatsApp messages</h3>\n<p>WhatsApp’s own marketing tool WhatsApp Business offers some automated message templates, but the selection isn't very broad. This is where the messaging app and marketing automation step in.</p>\n<p>With a marketing automation platform, you can automate the sending of the first message of the WhatsApp conversation, but also the next messages, based on the receiver’s reply. By setting triggers to the automation chain you can define what are the next steps in the conversation. The trigger can be that the receiver responds to the conversation in a certain way or that they respond at all.</p>\n<p>For example, you can create a message including a poll, and if the receiver answers \"A\", the next automatic message has content related to that option. You can also include trigger words in the message: if the reply has the word “iPhone”, the next automated messages can relate to that topic.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Automation workflow with WhatsApp messages. The next messages are automated based on the receiver's reply.first message includes a poll, and \" height=\"602\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/why-should-you-use-whatsapp-together-with-marketing-automation/cache/automation-workflow-whatsapp-poll-599x602.png\" width=\"599\"></p>\n<p>You can also hop in at any time and continue the conversation manually. </p>\n<p>With marketing automation, you can reach customers with the content they need right at that moment. This also applies to automated WhatsApp messages: you can inform the customer about their dentist appointment one day before, and ask for customer feedback after one day has passed since the visit.</p>\n<h3>Multiple marketing channels on one platform</h3>\n<p>When you choose a marketing automation platform that connects with WhatsApp, you can be sure that it has connections with other marketing channels, too.</p>\n<p>For example, with <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation/overview.html\">LianaAutomation</a> you can create automation workflows that consist of WhatsApp messages, newsletters, SMS messages, Google Ads, mobile app push notifications, and automated print campaigns.</p>\n<p>This way you can create way more comprehensive and more prosperous marketing campaigns than with WhatsApp alone. You also save time and money since most of the marketing actions can be done on one platform.</p>\n<h3>Save and utilize the data further</h3>\n<p>Using WhatsApp with a marketing automation solution means that the conversation data isn't just stored in the app. Thanks to integrations, your data flows back and forth between the solutions, which also enables the versatile utilization of data in your marketing campaigns. This makes your marketing efforts in WhatsApp much more effective and far-reaching.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of possibilities for how you can make use of the data flow. Here are a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can automatically save all the WhatsApp conversations to the customer’s profile in your CRM.</li>\n<li>You can add everyone who replied to your poll with the answer “A” to a specific mailing list.</li>\n<li>You can easily fetch the customer’s phone number with the automation system instead of adding them to your phone by hand. This also simplifies mass messaging to larger campaign groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>No cold messages</h3>\n<p>WhatsApp is not a channel for cold messaging – people use it mostly for personal purposes, which is why you need to pay even more attention to consent than when sending an email. If you start sending unsolicited messages, the receiver might easily block your number.</p>\n<p>By adding WhatsApp conversation as a part of your automation chain, you can ensure that there are enough meeting points along the customer path before the first message. This way your first message doesn’t come out of the blue.</p>\n<h3>Broader segmenting and targeting possibilities</h3>\n<p>In WhatsApp Business, it is possible to label contacts based on the conversations you had. The app has some default labels, like New customer and Order complete, but you can also add your own. This helps to categorize the conversations and makes finding the right conversations faster.</p>\n<p>Marketing automation takes the segmentation possibilities much further. Thanks to the software, the segmenting isn’t delimited only to WhatsApp. Instead, you can utilize the conversation data in all marketing channels you have connected with your automation tool.</p>\n<h2>Take WhatsApp's own marketing rules into account</h2>\n<p>WhatsApp wants to keep marketing on its platforms as relevant as possible. That is why a few rules apply to the communication carried out through it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When an organization contacts the client, messages must be sent using a message template pre-approved by WhatsApp. After this, the conversation can proceed freely.</li>\n<li>Direct sales and marketing messages are prohibited on WhatsApp – instead, the message must be related to customer service. For example, polls, bulletins, and delivery announcements are accepted message types.</li>\n<li>You must have the receiver’s permission to send them WhatsApp messages. Requesting a permit can be done, for example, with a separate permit inquiry on the company's website.</li>\n<li>WhatsApp communication is more restricted in certain industries, such as healthcare and the sale and import of alcohol.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to use marketing automation and WhatsApp together?</h2>\n<p>With a high-quality marketing automation tool and a trustworthy software provider, it is easy and fast to start enjoying the benefits of using marketing automation and WhatsApp together.</p>\n<h3>Set up WhatsApp</h3>\n<p>To be able to send WhatsApp messages with marketing automation, you must set up the WhatsApp messaging app for your business. Commissioning can be done by placing an order with Liana.</p>\n<p>To enable WhatsApp, your company must have an existing Facebook Business account. In the order process, your company gets its own unique WhatsApp number, which is registered based on your Facebook Business ID. You also need to fill out a form where you agree to the Whatsapp Client terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>It is good to allow time for the process, as it may take up to 2–5 weeks.</p>\n<h3>Create your automation workflows</h3>\n<p>After the WhatsApp account of your organisation is ready, you can start creating your automations. If you already have a marketing automation solution in use and WhatsApp is a new feature in the tool, go through your existing automation workflows and see if they can be streamlined with WhatsApp messages.</p>\n<p>Take your business hours into account when creating the automation chains. Don’t set the sending of the first message for the evening time if you know you’re unavailable then.</p>\n<div class=\"alert border border-200 bg-100\">Did you know that Liana’s marketing automation professionals are ready to help you to build automations that reach the results you wanted? Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/marketing-automation-as-a-service.html\">Marketing Automation as a Service</a>.</div>\n<h3>Collect contact information from your CRM</h3>\n<p>Use an <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/marketing-automation-crm-the-greatest-benefits-and-best-practices.html\">integration of your CRM and marketing automation software</a> to easily fetch customers’ phone numbers. Integrations also allow the data from WhatsApp conversations to flow back to your CRM.</p>\n<p>You need to start thinking of clever ways to collect phone numbers to grow your database. One simple way is to ask for the phone number in your subscription forms. The more data you have about your customers, the easier it is to send highly-targeted content and campaigns to them.</p>\n<h3>Respond to messages quickly</h3>\n<p>Fast responding is important – it makes your customers feel important and improves the customer experience. In fact, 76% of consumers on social media expect a response in the first 24 hours, 13% even during the first hour.</p>\n<p>By automating the WhatsApp conversations it’s easy to manage the timing of the messages. Despite the automation, it’s good to have people in your team on hold who are responsible for WhatsApp communication with customers.</p>\n<h2>Ideas for using WhatsApp in your automation chains</h2>\n<p>Be creative when using WhatsApp messages in your automations. You can create workflows that focus only on WhatsApp messages or combine multiple marketing channels in one automation.</p>\n<p>What is convenient is that WhatsApp conversations support multiple forms of media besides text. You can diversify the message content with images and links, for example.</p>\n<h3>Welcome and onboard new customers</h3>\n<p>Make your new customers feel welcome by sending them a WhatsApp message where you can give important information, share useful links and answer their questions.</p>\n<p>Marketing automation makes it easy to reply to FAQs rapidly. Create automated answers based on trigger words that are related to topics that customers often have questions about.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Automated WhatsApp conversation with a welcome message\" height=\"1051\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/why-should-you-use-whatsapp-together-with-marketing-automation/cache/marketing-automation-whatsapp-welcome-500x1051.png\" width=\"500\"></p>\n<p>Why not utilize WhatsApp messages also for <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/a-successful-customer-onboarding-process-what-is-it.html\">onboarding purposes</a>? You can share guideline videos of your products and tell your customer what other services you have to offer.</p>\n<h3>Collect feedback and reviews</h3>\n<p>WhatsApp is a handy channel to ask your customer's opinions about your services or products. Communication in WhatsApp is usually casual and fast, which means that the feedback you receive might be more accurate and honest. And that is only a good thing, right?</p>\n<p>Marketing automation ensures that the feedback process proceeds automatically on an ideal timetable. You can also automatically direct the feedback to your customer experience team, or to anyone to whom it applies.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Automated WhatsApp conversation with a feedback request message\" height=\"1053\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/why-should-you-use-whatsapp-together-with-marketing-automation/cache/marketing-automation-whatsapp-feedback-500x1053.png\" width=\"500\"></p>\n<h3>Send reminders</h3>\n<p>WhatsApp is an effective channel to keep your customers on track about their bookings, appointments, upcoming events, and expiring offers. You can be sure that the information reaches the receiver fast: <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/814813/frequency-with-which-us-internet-users-visit-whatsapp/\" target=\"_blank\">half of WhatsApp users check the app daily</a>.</p>\n<p>Reminder messages tend to have a positive impact on the customer experience. The customer learns that you are communicating about things to remember, and they learn which channels you are using for sending the reminders.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Automated WhatsApp conversation with a reminder message\" height=\"1050\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/why-should-you-use-whatsapp-together-with-marketing-automation/cache/marketing-automation-whatsapp-reminder-500x1050.png\" width=\"500\"></p>\n<p>Would you like to reach out to your customers and prospects in a new way?

      "content": "\n<p>Utilizing social media in communications and marketing is an everyday task for businesses. Most companies acknowledge that actively producing content in social media channels helps to make customers committed and satisfied. However, one thing that is forgotten in many organizations is social media monitoring and listening, even though it has the same effects as producing content for social media. Social media monitoring and listening don’t only help with customer commitment and satisfaction, it also gives a chance to develop your company without customers directly contacting you. </p>\n<p>If your business hasn’t yet started social media monitoring, now is the time to do so. Keep reading and you will find out how social media <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/press-release-distribution-and-media-monitoring/media-monitoring.html\">monitoring</a> and listening opens doors to better brand knowledge and lets you seek deeper down into conversations that are going around your company. </p>\n<h2>What is social media listening?</h2>\n<p>Social <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/6-reasons-why-media-monitoring-is-important-for-your-business.html\">media monitoring</a> and social media listening are often thought to be synonyms, even though they have slightly different meanings. Social media monitoring means following keywords and discussions on social media. Social media listening, in turn, is a more profound understanding and learning about the discussions on social media. It's more about meeting the customers' needs, recognizing trends, <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/guide-to-measuring-the-results-of-external-communications.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog_highlight\">measuring the effectiveness of your communications</a>, and learning from the competition.</p>\n<p>With social media monitoring and listening, you can track the conversations around your brand, your competitors, and your field. This way you know easily, what is being discussed, where, and how.</p>\n<p>Because the terms are close to each other, they easily get mixed up. It’s important to understand that social media monitoring can exist without social media listening but listening cannot exist without monitoring. That is why these two concepts are so strongly intertwined. In this article, we will go through three useful hints on how to start with social media listening.</p>\n<h3>1. Find out what customers think of you</h3>\n<p>It's a good idea to start social media listening by finding out what your current and potential customers think of you. Your customers are probably talking about you and your services without targeting their messages to you. Therefore, take advantage of search engines, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/press-release-distribution-and-media-monitoring/media-monitoring.html\">social media monitoring service</a> to find out in which channels and discussions your organization and brand are mentioned.</p>\n<p>With the help of these, you get a chance to answer or react to comments and posts that your company hasn’t even been tagged on. This means you will get access to content concerning your business that would have gone unnoticed otherwise. Your company should see this as a part of customer service because you can offer your customers service in situations where it wasn’t expected.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"558\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/new-blog-images-2018/3_tapaa_aloitta_sosiaalisen_median_kuuntelu.png\" width=\"561\"></p>\n<p class=\"small\">With social media monitoring, <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/?source=lp\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox </a>has been able to offer customer service in a situation where the customer hasn’t been expecting it from them. <em>(Source: <a href=\"https://badrhinoinc.com/blog/5-examples-companies-going-beyond-customer-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Rhino</a>)</em></p>\n<p>After this, pay attention to the tone of the discussion. What are the aspects that make the customers satisfied? How about the aspects they are not happy with? By following the discussion related to your brand you get feedback in real time and can quickly react to customers' comments.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"732\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/new-blog-images-2018/cache/3_tapaa_aloittaa_sosiaalisen_median_kuuntelu_alpro-2-500x732.png\" width=\"500\"></p>\n<p>By following the hashtag #alpro, <a href=\"https://www.alpro.com/caen/\" target=\"_blank\">Alpro </a>has been able to react to customers’ feedback, even though the company hasn’t been tagged on the post. This way the company has been able to follow with social media monitoring what people discuss about their products. <em>(Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter)</a></em></p>\n<p>Was your company not present in social media discussions? This is usually a sign of people not knowing enough about your operations. Be active in making your company recognizable and start marketing to both the press and the public.</p>\n<h3>2. Follow what is talked about around you</h3>\n<p>Social media listening should not be limited to your own operations. By paying attention to the buzz in your industry, you stay on top of trends and will be able to recognize the so-called silent signals that are especially helpful in product development and improving services.</p>\n<p>Follow the important hashtags and discussion groups of your industry. Find out which channels and groups the gurus and the opinion leaders of your industry follow and what terminology they use in their conversations. Also, search for the industry-specific keywords in discussion boards and blogs.</p>\n<p>Do your customers have a problem they are trying to solve that you could bring a solution to? Find out in which channels you could bring forth your know-how.</p>\n<p>Once you have found out where your colleagues and customers are having their discussions and what they discuss, just go out there and join the conversation. Ask, share your opinion and provide useful tips.</p>\n<p>Also, follow whether your activities yield good results. You have boosted active discussions with the people, but have they subscribed to your newsletter or contacted you? Are you mentioned in discussions more often? If the answer is no, keep on discussing.</p>\n<p><a name=\"blog-form-newsletter\"></a></p>\n<h3>3. Monitor your competition</h3>\n<p>After you know what your customers discuss and what they think of you, focus your attention on the competition. Follow what customers are talking about your competitors' products and how these rivals are taking part in social media discussions. Also, pay attention to what kind of content your competitors produce and how the public reacts to it.</p>\n<p>It's also good to learn from your competitors.  Pay attention to what kind of content competitors publish and see how the crowd reacts to it.  This way social media monitoring and listening will show you, what the company does to make their communication on social media work. Collect tips regarding discussions and content production.</p>\n<p>Always try to perform better than your competitors. Be active and produce genuinely gripping content on social media channels. If your rivals are not interested in taking part in your industry-related conversations, you have a good opportunity to show your own expertise and stay ahead of the competition. After you have achieved the desired position, don’t get too used to it. Social media is an ever-changing field, and you should always try to improve your presence there. However, with help of social media monitoring and listening, you can let go a bit. The tools can take part of the workload off your shoulders, especially if you use a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b-w1xhaQcc&amp;t=3s\" target=\"_blank\">media monitoring app</a>. The app can save your time by notifying you when something happens so you don’t have to spend time constantly checking your reports.</p>\n<h3>Where to get help for social media listening?</h3>\n<p>Simultaneously following your own brand, customers, and competitors on several social media channels can be a challenging task. <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/press-release-distribution-and-media-monitoring/overview.html\">Media monitoring tool LianaMonitor</a> collects all discussions on social media with keywords and hashtags. With a daily analysis, you get a clear picture of your visibility and you are always aware of what is talked about on social media.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/press-release-distribution-and-media-monitoring/overview.html\"><span class=\"btn btn-primary\">Is it time to start social media monitoring?

      "description": "What is the popularity of WordPress based on and why do so many people – from individuals to large organizations – choose to build their websites on WordPress? And what challenges should we be prepared for?",
      "content": "\n<p>Choosing a CMS platform comes up in every website project. Whether you're setting up a new site or revamping an old one, you often end up figuring out which platform best suits your needs.</p>\n<p>Originally developed for bloggers, WordPress is growing in popularity, with <a href=\"https://techjury.net/blog/percentage-of-wordpress-websites/#gref\" target=\"_blank\">almost 40% of all websites</a> now built on it. WordPress is growing faster than any other platform, <a href=\"https://www.envisagedigital.co.uk/wordpress-market-share/\" target=\"_blank\">with market share increasing by around 1-4% every year</a>.</p>\n<p>But what is the reason for this popularity and why do so many people – from individuals to large organizations – choose to build their websites on WordPress? And what challenges should we be prepared for?</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll look at the features, strengths, and weaknesses of the world's most popular CMS platform, and to which needs it fits best.</p>\n<h2>WordPress' strengths</h2>\n<h3>A huge ecosystem</h3>\n<p>WordPress is an open-source system, which means that anyone can download, install it, and edit it for free. It's also agile to deploy – it's practically ready to use as soon as you install it.</p>\n<p>The WordPress community includes tens of thousands of contributors who develop and update plug-ins compatible with the platform, such as marketing automation and eCommerce elements. This massive developer market is constantly driving WordPress forward.</p>\n<h3>A large and active developer community</h3>\n<p>There is plenty of WordPress help available. If you encounter a problem on your site, don't worry: someone has probably already solved it, and you'll get support quickly. There are a lot of potential developer partners to choose from, so there's also a lot of choice.</p>\n<p>With a large developer community, it's easy to outsource the maintenance, design, and development of WordPress websites. On the other hand, if you want to test your own skills, the web is full of guidelines and documentation to support WordPress development.</p>\n<h3>Customizability, add-ons, and scalability</h3>\n<p>One of the main advantages of WordPress is its versatility and customizability – it offers virtually unlimited possibilities for customization. There is a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">huge range of add-ons</a> and themes available for the publishing system, both free or not, so you can easily choose from a range of options to customize your site.</p>\n<h3>Low development costs</h3>\n<p>With carefully selected add-ons, you can easily boost your website project and save time and money. For example, the WooCommerce add-on makes it quick and easy to set up an online shop. Once you have the basis of your website in place, for example, built on top of a ready-made theme, it's easy to develop your site further.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"blog-form-newsletter\"></a></h4>\n<h2>WordPress' weaknesses</h2>\n<h3>Poor maintenance exposes your WordPress site to security problems</h3>\n<p>Open source also has its downsides: WordPress is an attractive target for hackers, and outdated versions and plug-ins in particular are a risk for WordPress sites. The use of well-known and trusted plug-ins reduces the likelihood of being attacked. This is why working with a reliable and competent WordPress development partner is absolutely essential.</p>\n<h3>A jungle of add-ons</h3>\n<p>Tens of thousands of plugins have been developed for the WordPress platform. Using and integrating the right, reliable plug-ins requires technical understanding and knowledge beyond the surface. Not all add-ons work with each other, which can become an issue, for example, when an add-on is updated. Get only the add-ons you need to keep the palette together: as a rule of thumb, get one add-on for one use.</p>\n<h3>The range of hosting services</h3>\n<p>Due to the popularity of WordPress, there are many different providers. Be careful when choosing a provider or web host: for example, the cheapest web hosts do not necessarily offer platform or plug-in upgrades. Failure to update your website will expose it to security problems.</p>\n<h3>Variability of authors and agencies</h3>\n<p>The skill level and implementation methods of the authors can widely vary, which requires the site owner to be aware of the issues. Again, pay attention to the type of agency you are working with to develop the site and check their backgrounds before signing any contracts.</p>\n<h2>When is WordPress the right choice?</h2>\n<p>WordPress is at its best in situations where the content requirements of the website are relatively light and the focus is on the visuals. For small businesses, for example, WordPress is a cost-effective option because it allows websites to be built using lightweight, off-the-shelf themes. In large-scale implementations, however, usability and maintenance experience can suffer if the site is grown heavy-handedly.</p>\n<p>As the level of sophistication of a site increases, more comprehensive web platforms should be considered. A good example is <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/websites/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">LianaCMS</a>, which is well suited for large-scale sites thanks to its clear content management tools. LianaCMS is best suited as a platform for customized websites, especially when there are many products, content, and user groups.</p>\n<div class=\"alert border border-200 bg-100\">In LianaCMS, managing user groups is more convenient than in WordPress, because it gives you more control. LianaCMS product development has been targeted specifically at more sophisticated implementations.</div>\n<p>Whatever the CMS, a customized website will cost more than a lightweight theme site.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"681\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/when-to-choose-wordpress/eventilla-en.png\" width=\"1467\"></p>\n<p><em>Liana's website for <a href=\"https://www.eventilla.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Eventilla</a> is a custom WordPress implementation. Customization means that the website has been built using special functionality and customization, such as visual design, rather than being created on top of a pre-built theme.</em></p>\n<h2>How do you choose the right website partner?</h2>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/websites/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> is your company's main marketing channel, so take the time to find a suitable partner and make a careful comparison between several providers.</p>\n<p>Let's say you've decided to choose WordPress as your CMS platform. Great! You are again faced with a choice: how do you choose a partner that will work with you and achieve your goals?</p>\n<p>Choosing a partner can be complicated by the fact that there are so many different providers in the WordPress space. In addition, the platform allows you to implement the same thing in different ways: it is, therefore, worth finding out what kind of WordPress policies the provider has in place, in terms of content management, for example. Also, ask them in general about their experience with different implementations and ask for references. Remember that price is rarely the determining factor in website projects.</p>\n<p>The challenges of WordPress are surmountable when you choose a reliable partner. You can ask directly how they overcome the most common WordPress problems. Be sure to go through the basics as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What kind of support services do they offer?</li>\n<li>How big of a player is it?</li>\n<li>Will you be able to grow and evolve with your partner?</li>\n<li>A good website partner will be able to suggest the right solutions based on the goals you set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have been happy with your website partner, there is no point in changing. On the other hand, if your partner is no longer able to provide you with what you need, for example, because your goals have changed, it may be time to consider looking for a new partner.</p>\n<h2>Website implementations from Liana</h2>\n<h3>WordPress website transfers (hosting)</h3>\n<p>We offer a website hosting service, which means that we take control of your existing WordPress site. We maintain and update the site and provide support and further development. The transfer includes a survey of the site's content and add-ons, as well as a review and testing of functionality.</p>\n<h3>Thematic implementations</h3>\n<p>We implement WordPress websites using lightweight theme implementations. We have a wide range of themes available, so you can choose the one that suits you best. Theme implementations are a great choice, especially when you want a visually striking site. Themes also provide the opportunity to create small eCommerce implementations.</p>\n<h3>Tailored implementations</h3>\n<p>We create <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/websites/pricing/company-website.html\" target=\"_blank\">customized implementations</a> on both WordPress and LianaCMS platforms, depending on the use case, and the needs and objectives of the client. A customized theme is available for WordPress, with basic functionalities ready, on which it is easy to build a customized implementation. Custom implementations are often more complex to implement and therefore more expensive than theme implementations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/contact-us/book-a-demo.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"btn btn-primary\">Are you planning a website redesign?

      "content": "\n<p>Understanding what is happening around you is the first fundamental step to long-term success.</p>\n<p>Media monitoring helps you to stay up-to-date with the latest trends without using up too much of your resources. We collected 6 reasons why you should get started with <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/pr-media/overview.html\">media monitoring</a>.</p>\n<h2>1. Build a strong brand</h2>\n<p>A strong brand identity is a valuable asset in today's information-packed society filled with brands competing for attention. Media monitoring helps you to see what people think about your brand. Are they aware that your brand exists? Do they understand what your brand is about? Media monitoring enables you to spot any misconceptions so you can take action to correct them.</p>\n<p>Media monitoring will also help you notice any pitfalls in your communications. Check that your brand's tone of voice is consistent when publishing blog articles or social media posts. This way you have the strongest chance of connecting with your target customers.</p>\n<h2>2. Manage your reputation and respond to crisis situations</h2>\n<p>With a media monitoring service, you can closely follow what is written about your company and what the tone of the discussion is. Speed is of the essence, especially in social media where discussions – both positive and negative – arise quickly.</p>\n<p>The monitoring tool will notify you as soon as your brand is mentioned in journalistic or social media.

Elevate your brand with key opinion leaders</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/key-opinion-leaders-who-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter.html\">Key Opinion Leaders</a> (KOLs) are thought leaders whose opinions are valued in a specific industry. Cooperation with the right influencer can skyrocket your brand awareness, strengthen customer relationships and boost your sales.</p>\n<p>Media monitoring helps you to follow the experts, bloggers, “gurus” and advocacies in your business and find the best fit for your brand. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"shadow-image\" height=\"643\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/6-reasons-why-media-monitoring-is-important/influencer.png\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<p class=\"small\"><em>Jack Morris is one of the most popular influencers when it comes to the traveling industry.

Know your industry and competitors</h2>\n<p>Media monitoring is a simple way to find out about the latest developments in your industry: recognize future trends and predict possible spikes in demand for your products and services. When you see what’s coming, you can plan your strategy in advance and take action immediately when it’s timely.</p>\n<p>Media monitoring also lets you discover who your competitors are. Benchmarking what other organizations in your industry are doing is useful in your own brand work. Learn from the companies or organizations you follow how they use communications to increase awareness about them. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What can your organization learn from them and how to utilize what they have learned?</li>\n<li>How do your partners appear in the media and could you benefit from their publicity?</li>\n<li>Gather data about your main competitors so you can set your own goals for visibility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow what the competition is doing and analyze their actions. This way you can avoid repeating the mistakes your competitors are doing, but also develop the areas in which your competitors do better.</p>\n<h2>5. Measure the effectiveness of your communications</h2>\n<p>Media monitoring is a great strategic tool to measure and improve the effectiveness of your communications. You can closely follow how much media attention your actions receive. Do you reach your target audiences? Do you get the reaction you intended? Media monitoring data works as a <a href=\"https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-can-media-monitoring-support-sales-6-tips.html\">reliable source for decision-making</a>.</p>\n<p>The best thing about a monitoring tool is convenience. It does all the (boring) manual tasks on your behalf. It collects and analyzes the data for you, stacks all the hits, and sends the report directly to your email at chosen times. Media monitoring saves your precious time and lets you focus on developing your strategy and planning future actions.</p>\n<p>The reports and analytics also help convince the company management. With the data, you can show that your PR has been profitable and you have achieved concrete results.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"shadow-image\" height=\"487\" kv_aslink=\"0\" src=\"https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/6-reasons-why-media-monitoring-is-important/article_pressrelease.png\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<p class=\"small\"><em>A monitoring tool makes it easy to follow where your press release ends up after being published.</em></p>\n<h2>6. Find ideas for new content</h2>\n<p>As any marketing and comms pro knows, it’s important to create fresh content constantly. Yet, we tend to find ourselves in the same spot time and time again: \"I have no idea what to write about.\"</p>\n<p>Media monitoring helps you stay inspired. Set up a monitor of your industry to see what topics are trending on a general level. If you already have a topic in your mind, try following related keywords. This way you will find new creative ideas and angles for your content. You can also use your opponents’ ideas as a source of inspiration or as a warning for what doesn’t work.</p>\n<p>Data is your best friend when brainstorming content ideas.
