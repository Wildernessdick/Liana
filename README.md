Coding Assignment: Front-End

Your task is to build a responsive HTML page based on the file provided [here](https://github.com/Wildernessdick/Liana/blob/master/Liana%20Technologies/Recruitment%20Demo%202022/Liana%20Technologies%20-%20Recruitment%20Demo.jpg)
. 
The task's goal is to show your core HTML/CSS skills. CSS frameworks like Flexbox and Bootstrap are ok, but large JS frameworks like React/Vue/Angular are not allowed. We hope to find the following things from your work:

Basic skills:
•	HTML+CSS
•	The page is responsive on different devices

Extra points (Javascript/RSS/parallax):
•	Main image with parallax Latest News section of the RSS feed: https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog.rss (For CORS issues you can use https://code4developers.com/cors-anywhere/)
•	Clients, Employees and Users sections with animated numbers
•	Newsletter subscription and thank you notification
•	Other skills may be demonstrated as well
